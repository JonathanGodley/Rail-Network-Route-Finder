# COMP2230 Assignment

**Due 26 October**

TODO:
* Create a Station Object that can hold all the information about it's neighbours and travel times
* Create a Function that reads from an input XML file and then stores all the stations (I think we need to use a Heap, I'm not sure, but we need to make sure whatever we use works with the algorithm specified) - **NOTE:** It is advised that you investigate the many pre-existing libraries (for Java or C++) available for
                                                              working with XML and incorporate those into your program. Then, reading the data from the
                                                              xml file and navigating the data should amount to (reasonably) simple calls to the classes and
                                                              methods of the library in question.
* Workout how to add edges in Graph. An indirect heap graph tends to only have verteices so unsure how to add the edge information.
